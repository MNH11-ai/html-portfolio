<h1>About Me</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am currently studying and working on a Java-based Library Management System.
  This project involves managing features like book loans, returns, and user registrations,
  and I am utilizing object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and
  interfaces to design the system. My User class includes attributes like userID, name, email,
  phoneNumber, address, and loanedBooks, and I am developing methods for borrowing and returning books,
   as well as handling loan fees. To improve user experience, I am implementing interactive
   input with validation to ensure correct data entry.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to my Java project, I am also exploring mathematical 
  topics related to matrix operations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. 
  I am comparing naive and vectorized methods for matrix multiplication and 
  studying banded matrix storage schemes to efficiently solve linear systems using 
  tools like SciPy. My interest lies in both the analytical and computational aspects 
  of these topics, and I am applying Python to solve problems and analyze performance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My academic journey reflects a strong passion for programming and mathematics.
   I enjoy blending these fields to create practical solutions and solve complex problems,
    always aiming to optimize performance and usability in my projects.</p>
